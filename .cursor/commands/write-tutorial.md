description: How to write a tutorial from a set of input files
---

Take the input files which are all part of a subject, and figure out what they have in common. Then create a tutorial for absolute beginners who know nothing about the subject and teach them from the basics, smoothly advancing to each topic in a connected fashion. Be sure not only to explain what but the why with examples that they will immediately understand. The examples can start non-technical and analogies and quickly transition into the technical and practical. Provide plenty of examples at every step and also make sure there is sufficient relatable exposition that will aid in comprehension. Use an emotional story arc but in a dry technical and factual basis. Not too much code but not too little, an elegant balance of paragraphs, sentences, and code snippets. Sequence the presentation so each idea logically follows the previous, and at intervals reward the reader with insights and a-ha moments that empower and delight them. Cover all the material. Don't oversection or undersection. Sections should be meaningful: different enough from the last section to justify its existence, and exciting and something for the reader to look forward to. Write the result in markdown to the output file.
